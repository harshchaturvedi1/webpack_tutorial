# Notes on Setting Up Webpack and Building a Project

## Overview

- This video demonstrates setting up a basic project using Webpack.
- Covers file structure, creating a build, and running the application.

## Steps to Set Up and Configure Webpack

### 1. Project Initialization

- **Initialize a new project:**
  - Use the command: `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file.
- **Install Webpack:**
  - Install Webpack and Webpack CLI using:
    ```
    npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
    ```

### 2. File Structure

- **Required Folders:**

  - `src`: Contains all source code files.
  - `dist`: The output folder for the bundled code.

- **Entry Point:**
  - Create a file named `index.js` in the `src` folder.
  - This file acts as the main entry point for Webpack.

### 3. Writing Code

- **Export and Import Example:**
  - Create a JavaScript file with a function:
    ```javascript
    // src/another.js
    export function greet() {
      return "Hello from another file!";
    }
    ```
  - Import and use the function in `index.js`:
    ```javascript
    import { greet } from "./another.js";
    console.log(greet());
    ```

### 4. Creating a Build

- Add a build script in `package.json`:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
      "build": "webpack"
  }
  ```
